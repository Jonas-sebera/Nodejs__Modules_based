NOTE that the standard way is to declare needed modules in their own position together


Nodejs is a runtime environment for running javascript code
it is used to run javascript code outside a web browser
it is used to make APIs
APIs are servises that power client applications
 
 NODEJS is used to build ;
     -highly scalable,data intensive and real time applications

    other tools fot building backend services:
     -ASP.NET  
     -JANGO etc
//But note that node is neither a programming language nor a framework, instead, it is a runtime environment

     what is special with nodejs??
      -easy to get started
      -great for prototyping and agile environment
      -Superfast and highly scalable
      -used in production by large companies like NETFLIX etc

      NODE APP => ;
       -Built twice as fast with fewer pple
       -33% fewer lines of code
       -40% fewer files
       -2x request/services
       -35% faster response time
       -Uses javascript language
       -Cleaner and more consistent codebase
       -large ecosystem of an open source libraries


//HOW NODE WORKS

It is non-blocking

It uses asynchronous achitecture(Non-blocking)
means it continues its usual work even if there are other events to full fill

//Single thread is used to handle multiple requests

//Blocking or synchronous
Thread just waits until a an active request is over


with node js,
When then the database is executing the data, 
   a single thread doesnot still wait for the database to execute the data. instead, 
    it moves on to another request as the first request is being processed

hence due to this ability, nodejs can be used to build I/O intensive applications

 NOTE: Nodejs should not be used in CPU intensive applications
like: video encoding or on image manipulation servers

XOXO, jonas....enough theory
